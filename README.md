This repository attempts to build Braj ASR system using transformers. The steps involved in fine tuning the Facebook developed pre-trained models are mentioned, and can be followed to train ASR system in other language. For this demonstration, we show training using samples of karya Braj data. The trained model can be used to decode test audio with or without language model.
